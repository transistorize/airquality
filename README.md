#Air Quality Project

   This Air Quality code is a joint project between MIT and the Cypress Hills Elementary School in New York, NY. This 'Eggsitting' website is mostly designed for one-time use and manual deployment. It is not a fully featured website. 
   
   Some Notes About Frameworks:

   This project was an initial prototype to create a general data platform like xively.com or similar. Standard CMS frameworks were not used in order to allow for more flexibility in processing and displaying general data. MAINTAINERS should feel free to modify the user facing code to use a standard framework beyond Express, to make for easier handling of user-generated content.
